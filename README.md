Here i have attached few test cases that I have written when I was handled a project called cloudmatiq. cloudmatiq is a web application that helps to manage multiple cloud service providers in a single web application. l was responsible for functional testing, identifying bugs and issues, and
collaborating with the development team to resolve them. I have followed the Agile methodology.
