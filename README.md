Here i have attached few test cases that I have written when I was handled a project called cloudmatiq. cloudmatiq is a web application that helps to manage multiple cloud service providers in a single web application. l was responsible for functional testing, identifying bugs and issues, and
collaborating with the development team to resolve them. I have followed the Agile methodology. Moreover, Here I have attached personal projects Cura Healthcare Service and ToolsQA. Kindly go through it. In this project I have followed skills like Automation Testing, Selenium, Python, Pycharm, Unit Testing, Unit Integration Testing, System Testing, Black Box testing and STLC. I have utilized these skills to determine the quality level of the web application and to find bugs.
